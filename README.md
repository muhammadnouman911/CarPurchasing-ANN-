# 🚗 **CarPurchasing-ANN** 🚗

Welcome to **CarPurchasing-ANN**, a machine learning project that predicts car purchasing decisions using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**! This project leverages Python and powerful data science libraries to help you understand how ANNs can be applied to make predictions from real-world datasets. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this project will provide valuable insights into neural networks and predictive modeling.

## 🚀 **Project Highlights**

- **Predictive Modeling**: Use an ANN to predict car purchasing behavior based on historical data.
- **Hands-On Machine Learning**: Learn how to train an ANN model, preprocess data, and evaluate its performance.
- **Practical Dataset**: A real-world dataset to train the model and make predictions.

## 📂 **Repository Structure**

- **`README.md`**: You're reading it! Get to know the project.
- **`car_purchase_ann.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook where the magic happens. This file contains the implementation of the ANN model, data preprocessing, and evaluation.
- **`car_purchasing.csv`**: A CSV dataset with information related to car purchases. This dataset serves as the foundation for training our model.

## 🛠️ **Installation**

To get started with the project, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadmadnouman911/CarPurchasing-ANN.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📝 **How to Use**

1. Open the `car_purchase_ann.ipynb` file in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
2. Execute the code step-by-step to train the ANN model on the dataset.
3. Explore the model's predictions, tune hyperparameters, and assess the model's accuracy and performance.
